# Chatbot Project
Using Python, I developed this conversational chatbot to respond to inbuilt prompts using pre-determined randomized responses. I then used Tkinter, a GUI Python framework, to support the program with an interactive interface.
What I enjoyed about this project was the figuring out how to implement the Tkinter interface because of how complete it made the program feel. In the future, I plan on implementing natural langauge processing techniques to understand user a wider range of user inputs and ultimately increase user experience.
